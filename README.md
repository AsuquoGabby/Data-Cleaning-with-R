## Introduction
**Data Cleaning** can be said to be a process of identifying and correcting (or removing) errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data. with the goal of improving the quality of the data, making it more accurate, reliable, and suitable for analysis.Data Cleaning is very important in Data Analysis as a clean data would increase accuracy of any analysis or insights derived from it.Therefore a clean data enables Data Analysts to perform their tasks more effectively and deliver more valuable insights to their organizations.

## Problem Statement 
FIFA datasets are invaluable resources for analyzing player performance, scouting talent, and developing strategic insights in football. These datasets encompass a wide range of player details, including personal information, physical attributes, and performance metrics. However, like many large datasets, FIFA datasets often suffer from issues such as missing values, inconsistent data formats, and erroneous entries, which can impede accurate analysis and decision-making.

## Objectives 
The primary objective of this project is to clean and preprocess the FIFA player datasets to ensure data integrity and accuracy.The goal is to prepare a high-quality, reliable dataset that can be used for various analytical purposes.The project contain a step by step process of how i cleaned the fifa datasets, which includes some of the following steps, **checking for and removing of duplicate**,**Identifying and rectifying issues such as missing value**, **checking for inaccuracies in date**, **Data standardization** and lot more 

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. I hope you find the insights useful.
